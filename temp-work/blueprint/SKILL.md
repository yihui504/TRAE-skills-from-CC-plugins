# Blueprint — Construction Plan Generator

Turn a one-line objective into a step-by-step construction plan that any coding agent can execute cold.

## When to Use

- Breaking a large feature into multiple PRs with clear dependency order
- Planning a refactor or migration that spans multiple sessions
- Coordinating parallel workstreams across sub-agents
- Any task where context loss between sessions would cause rework
- As Phase 1 of the AI engineering pipeline (blueprint → ADR → eval-harness → self-improve → ai-slop-cleaner)

**Do not use** for tasks completable in a single PR, fewer than 3 tool calls, or when the user says "just do it."

## How It Works

Blueprint runs a 5-phase pipeline:

1. **Research** — Pre-flight checks (git, gh auth, remote, default branch), then reads project structure, existing plans, and memory files to gather context.
2. **Design** — Breaks the objective into one-PR-sized steps (3–12 typical). Assigns dependency edges, parallel/serial ordering, and rollback strategy per step.
3. **Draft** — Writes a self-contained Markdown plan file to `plans/`. Every step includes a context brief, task list, verification commands, and exit criteria — so a fresh agent can execute any step without reading prior steps.
4. **Review** — Delegates adversarial review to a sub-agent against a checklist and anti-pattern catalog. Fixes all critical findings before finalizing.
5. **Register** — Saves the plan, updates memory index, and presents the step count and parallelism summary to the user.

Blueprint detects git/gh availability automatically. With git + GitHub CLI, it generates full branch/PR/CI workflow plans. Without them, it switches to direct mode (edit-in-place, no branches).

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Research

1. Check if git is available: `git --version`
2. Check if GitHub CLI is available: `gh --version`
3. If git is available, check: `git remote -v`, `git branch --show-current`
4. Read project structure: list top-level files and directories
5. Check for existing plans in `plans/` directory
6. Check for existing ADR records in `docs/adr/`
7. Check for existing eval definitions in `.claude/evals/` or `.omc/evals/`
8. Gather context from README, package.json, or equivalent project metadata

### Phase 2: Design

1. Break the objective into discrete steps (3–12 steps)
2. For each step, determine:
   - **Dependencies**: which steps must complete first
   - **Parallel potential**: can this step run concurrently with others?
   - **Scope**: files and modules affected
   - **Rollback strategy**: how to undo if something goes wrong
3. Build a dependency graph identifying parallel vs serial steps

### Phase 3: Draft

Write the plan as a Markdown file to `plans/{project-slug}-{objective-slug}.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Plan: {Objective}

## Overview
{1-2 sentence summary}

## Dependency Graph
{ASCII or Mermaid diagram showing step dependencies}

## Parallelism Summary
- Serial steps: {count}
- Parallel groups: {count}
- Total steps: {count}

---

## Step 1: {Title}

### Context Brief
{Self-contained context so a fresh agent can execute this step without reading prior steps}

### Tasks
- [ ] {task 1}
- [ ] {task 2}

### Verification
{Commands to verify step completion}

### Exit Criteria
{Measurable conditions for step completion}

### Rollback
{How to undo changes if needed}

---

## Step 2: {Title}
...
```

### Phase 4: Review

1. Use the Task tool (subagent_type="search") to perform adversarial review of the plan
2. Review checklist:
   - Completeness: are all necessary steps included?
   - Dependency correctness: are dependencies accurate and minimal?
   - Anti-pattern detection: does the plan avoid known anti-patterns?
   - Cold-start viability: can each step be executed independently?
   - Verification adequacy: are exit criteria measurable?
3. Fix all critical findings before finalizing

### Phase 5: Register

1. Save the finalized plan file
2. Present summary to user:
   ```
   Blueprint complete: {N} steps, {P} parallel groups
   Plan saved to: plans/{filename}
   Next: Run architecture-decision-records to capture key decisions, then eval-harness to define success metrics.
   ```

## Anti-Pattern Catalog

Watch for and avoid these common planning anti-patterns:

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **God Step** | A single step that does too much | Split into smaller, focused steps |
| **Hidden Dependency** | Step depends on another but doesn't declare it | Make dependency explicit |
| **Vague Exit Criteria** | "It works" instead of measurable conditions | Add specific test commands or assertions |
| **Missing Rollback** | No way to undo if step fails | Add git branch or backup strategy |
| **Context Assumption** | Step assumes knowledge from prior steps | Add context brief |
| **Sequential Bias** | Steps marked serial when they could be parallel | Check for independent file sets |

## Plan Mutation Protocol

When the plan needs to change after creation:

| Operation | Protocol |
|---|---|
| **Split** | Replace step N with N.1, N.2; update dependencies |
| **Insert** | Add step between existing steps; renumber and update dependencies |
| **Skip** | Mark step as skipped with reason; update dependent steps |
| **Reorder** | Move step and update all dependency edges |
| **Abandon** | Mark entire plan as abandoned with reason |

All mutations must be recorded in the plan file with timestamp and reason.

## Pipeline Integration

This skill is Phase 1 of the AI engineering pipeline. After completing the blueprint:

1. **Phase 2**: Invoke the `architecture-decision-records` skill to capture architectural decisions made during planning
2. **Phase 3**: Invoke the `eval-harness` skill to define success metrics for the plan
3. **Phase 4**: Invoke the `self-improve` skill to automatically optimize implementation
4. **Phase 5**: Invoke the `ai-slop-cleaner` skill to clean up after evolution

## Examples

### Basic usage

User says: "migrate database to PostgreSQL"

Produces `plans/myapp-migrate-database-to-postgresql.md` with steps like:
- Step 1: Add PostgreSQL driver and connection config
- Step 2: Create migration scripts for each table
- Step 3: Update repository layer to use new driver
- Step 4: Add integration tests against PostgreSQL
- Step 5: Remove old database code and config

### Multi-agent project

User says: "extract LLM providers into a plugin system"

Produces a plan with parallel steps where possible (e.g., "implement Anthropic plugin" and "implement OpenAI plugin" run in parallel after the plugin interface step is done), and invariants verified after every step (e.g., "all existing tests pass", "no provider imports in core").
