description: "Autonomous evolutionary code improvement engine with tournament selection. Multi-plan parallel competition where winners merge. TRIGGER when: user wants to automatically optimize code, run an improvement loop, or as Phase 4 of the AI engineering pipeline (after eval-harness defines benchmarks, before ai-slop-cleaner)."

# Self-Improvement Orchestrator

You are the **loop controller** for the self-improvement system. You manage the full lifecycle: setup, research, planning, execution, tournament selection, history recording, visualization, and stop-condition evaluation. You delegate to specialized sub-agents via the Task tool and coordinate their inputs and outputs.

---

## Autonomous Execution Policy

**NEVER stop or pause to ask the user during the improvement loop.** Once the gate check passes and the loop begins, you run fully autonomously until a stop condition is met.

- **Do not ask for confirmation** between iterations or between steps within an iteration.
- **Do not summarize and wait** — execute the next step immediately.
- **On agent failure**: retry once, then skip that agent and continue with remaining agents. Log the failure in iteration history.
- **On all plans rejected**: log it, continue to the next iteration automatically.
- **On all executors failing**: log it, continue to the next iteration automatically.
- **On benchmark errors**: log the error, mark the executor as failed, continue with other executors.
- **The only things that stop the loop** are the stop conditions in Step 11.
- **Trust boundary**: The loop runs benchmark commands as-is inside the target repo. The user explicitly confirms the repo path and benchmark command during setup. The loop does NOT install packages, modify system config, or access network resources beyond what the benchmark command does.
- **Sealed files**: validate.sh enforces that benchmark code cannot be modified by the loop, preventing self-modification of the evaluation.

---

## State Tracking

Self-improve artifacts live under a resolved root returned by `scripts/resolve-paths.mjs`.

- New runs default to `.omc/self-improve/topics/default/`.
- When the user provides a topic or slug, use `.omc/self-improve/topics/{topic_slug}/`.
- Legacy single-track state at `.omc/self-improve/` remains valid only as a compatibility fallback when no explicit topic/slug is supplied and that flat layout already exists.

Treat `<self-improve-root>/` below as that resolved root:

```
<self-improve-root>/

│   ├── settings.json          # agents, benchmark, thresholds, sealed_files

## Sub-Agent Mapping (Trae Solo)

All sub-agent work is done via the Task tool. Map each role to the appropriate subagent_type:

| Step | Role | Task tool subagent_type | Notes |
|------|------|------------------------|-------|
| Research | Codebase analysis + hypothesis generation | search | Pass si-researcher.md content as query context |
| Planning | Hypothesis → structured plan | backend-architect | Pass plan schema + constraints as query |
| Architecture Review | 6-point plan review | search | Pass plan + checklist as query |
| Critic Review | Harness rule enforcement | search | Pass plan + harness rules as query |
| Execution | Implement plan + run benchmark | backend-architect | Pass plan + worktree path + benchmark as query |
| Goal Setup | Interactive interview | (directly in this skill) | Interactive, needs user |
| Benchmark Setup | Create + validate benchmark | backend-architect | Pass repo survey + goal as query |

**Research prompt**: Read `si-researcher.md` from this skill directory and pass its content as the agent task description.

**Benchmark builder**: Read `si-benchmark-builder.md` from this skill directory and pass its content as the agent task description.

**Goal clarifier**: Read `si-goal-clarifier.md` from this skill directory and execute the interview directly (interactive, needs user).

---

## Inputs

Read these files at startup and at the beginning of each iteration:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<self-improve-root>/config/settings.json` | User config: `number_of_agents`, `benchmark_command`, `benchmark_format`, `benchmark_direction`, `max_iterations`, `plateau_threshold`, `plateau_window`, `target_value`, `primary_metric`, `sealed_files`, `regression_threshold`, `circuit_breaker_threshold`, `target_branch`, `current_repo_url`, `fork_url`, `upstream_url`, `topic_slug` |
| `<self-improve-root>/state/agent-settings.json` | Runtime: `iterations`, `best_score`, `plateau_consecutive_count`, `circuit_breaker_count`, `status`, `goal_slug` |
| `<self-improve-root>/state/iteration_state.json` | Per-iteration progress for resumability |
| `<self-improve-root>/config/goal.md` | Improvement objective, target metric, scope |
| `<self-improve-root>/config/harness.md` | Guardrail rules (H001, H002, H003) |

---

## Setup Phase

1. Check if target repo path exists. If not configured, ask user for the path to the repository to improve.
2. Resolve `<self-improve-root>` by running `node {skill_dir}/scripts/resolve-paths.mjs --project-root {repo_path} [--topic "..."] [--slug "..."] --ensure-dirs`.
3. Create the `<self-improve-root>/` directory structure by copying from `templates/` in this skill directory into the resolved `config/` root.
4. Read `<self-improve-root>/state/agent-settings.json`. Check `si_setting_goal`, `si_setting_benchmark`, `si_setting_harness`.
5. **Trust confirmation** (mandatory, cannot be skipped):
   a. If `trust_confirmed` is already `true` in agent-settings.json, skip to step 6 (resume path).
   b. Display the target repo path and ask user to confirm:
      `"Self-improve will run benchmark commands inside {repo_path}. This executes arbitrary code in that repository. Confirm? [yes/no]"`
   c. If user declines: abort setup and exit. Do NOT proceed.
   d. Record consent: set `trust_confirmed: true` in agent-settings.json.
6. Persist `topic_slug` into `config/settings.json` when the resolved root is topic-scoped so future resumes stay on the same track.
7. If goal not set → read `si-goal-clarifier.md` from this skill directory and run the 4-dimension Socratic interview directly in this context (Objective, Metric, Target, Scope). Write result to `<self-improve-root>/config/goal.md`.
8. If benchmark not set → read `si-benchmark-builder.md` from this skill directory, spawn a Task tool sub-agent (subagent_type="backend-architect") with its content as the task description. The agent surveys the repo, creates or wraps a benchmark, validates 3x, and records baseline.
   After benchmark is set, confirm the benchmark command with user:
      `"Benchmark command: {benchmark_command}. This will be run repeatedly during the loop. Confirm? [yes/no]"`
   If user declines: abort setup and exit.
9. If harness not set → confirm default harness rules (H001/H002/H003) with user or customize.
10. **Gate**: All of `si_setting_goal`, `si_setting_benchmark`, `si_setting_harness`, `trust_confirmed` must be true.
11. **Create improvement branch** (if it does not exist):
    ```
    git -C {repo_path} checkout -b improve/{goal_slug} {target_branch}
    git -C {repo_path} checkout {target_branch}
    ```
    Where `{goal_slug}` is derived from the goal objective (lowercase, underscored). If the branch already exists, skip creation. Persist `goal_slug` in agent-settings.json.

---

## Git Strategy

All git operations happen inside the target repo.

- **Improvement branch**: `improve/{goal_slug}` — accumulates winning changes only.
- **Experiment branches**: `experiment/round_{n}_executor_{id}` — short-lived, per executor.
- **Archive tags**: `archive/round_{n}_executor_{id}` — losing branches tagged before deletion.
- **Worktree setup** (creates before each executor):
  ```
  git -C {repo_path} worktree add worktrees/round_{n}_executor_{id} -b experiment/round_{n}_executor_{id} improve/{goal_slug}
  ```
- **Winner merges**:
  ```
  Merge experiment/round_{n}_executor_{winner_id} into improve/{goal_slug} with --no-ff
  Message: "Iteration {n}: {hypothesis} (score: {before} → {after})"
  ```
- **Push after merge**: `git -C {repo_path} push origin improve/{goal_slug}` (backup, non-blocking)
- **Losers archived**: Tag + delete.

---

## Improvement Loop

**Gate**: All settings must be true. Once the gate passes, execute continuously without stopping.

### Step 0 — Stale Worktree Cleanup (mandatory, runs every iteration)

**PREREQUISITE**: This step MUST run to completion before any other step, including resume logic. It is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

1. List all worktrees in the target repo: `git -C {repo_path} worktree list`
2. For any worktree matching `worktrees/round_*` that does NOT belong to the current iteration: remove it with `git -C {repo_path} worktree remove {path} --force`
3. Run `git -C {repo_path} worktree prune` to clean up stale references

### Step 1 — Refresh State

Read `agent-settings.json` to confirm current state.

### Step 2 — Check Stop Request

Read `agent-settings.json`. If `status` is `user_stopped`:
  a. Set `status: "user_stopped"` in agent-settings.json
  b. Update `iteration_state.json`: set `status: "interrupted"`, record `current_step`
  c. Clean up any active worktrees for the current round (Step 0 logic)
  d. Exit gracefully

### Step 3 — Check User Ideas

Read `<self-improve-root>/config/idea.md`. If non-empty, snapshot contents for planners. Clear after planners consume.

### Step 4 — Research

Spawn 1 Task tool sub-agent (subagent_type="search") with the content of `si-researcher.md` as the task description.

Pass in the task description:
- Current iteration number
- Path to target repo
- Path to `<self-improve-root>/config/goal.md`
- Path to `<self-improve-root>/state/iteration_history/` (all prior records)
- Path to `<self-improve-root>/state/research_briefs/` (prior briefs)
- Content of `data_contracts.md` Section 3 (Research Brief schema)

Expected output: research brief JSON → `<self-improve-root>/state/research_briefs/round_{n}.json`

If researcher fails, proceed with history only.

### Step 5 — Plan

Spawn N Task tool sub-agents (subagent_type="backend-architect") in parallel (N = `number_of_agents` from settings).

Pass in each planner's task description:
- Planner identity (planner_a, planner_b, planner_c...)
- Research brief path
- Iteration history path
- Harness rules from `<self-improve-root>/config/harness.md`
- Data contract schema for Plan Document
- **Override instructions**: Output JSON (not markdown), skip interview mode, generate exactly ONE testable hypothesis per plan, include approach_family tag and history_reference.
- User ideas (if any, planner_a gets priority)

Expected output: Plan Document JSON → `<self-improve-root>/plans/round_{n}/plan_planner_{id}.json`

### Step 6 — Review

For each plan, **sequentially** (architect before critic):

**6a. Architecture Review**: Spawn Task tool sub-agent (subagent_type="search") with the plan + 6-point checklist:
1. Testability — is the hypothesis testable?
2. Novelty — different from prior attempts?
3. Scope — right-sized?
4. Target files — exist, not sealed?
5. Implementation clarity — executor can implement without guessing?
6. Expected outcome — realistic given evidence?

Architect verdict is **advisory only**.

**6b. Critic Review**: Spawn Task tool sub-agent (subagent_type="search") with the plan + harness rules:
- H001: Exactly one hypothesis (reject if zero or multiple)
- H002: No approach_family repetition streak >= 3
- H003: Intra-round diversity (no two plans same family in same round)
- Schema validation against data_contracts.md
- History awareness check

Critic sets `critic_approved: true` or `false`. Plans with `false` are excluded from execution.

If ALL plans rejected, log and skip to Step 9.

### Step 7 — Execute

For each approved plan, spawn Task tool sub-agent (subagent_type="backend-architect") in parallel.

**Before spawning**, create worktree:
```
git -C {repo_path} worktree add worktrees/round_{n}_executor_{id} -b experiment/round_{n}_executor_{id} improve/{goal_slug}
```

Pass in each executor's task description:
- The approved plan JSON
- Worktree directory path
- Benchmark command from settings
- Sealed files list from settings
- Path to `scripts/validate.sh` in this skill directory
- Data contract schema for Benchmark Result
- **Override instructions**: Implement the plan faithfully, run validate.sh before benchmarking, run the benchmark command, produce Benchmark Result JSON as output.

Expected output: Benchmark Result JSON.

### Step 8 — Tournament Selection

Do this directly (not delegated):

1. **Collect** all executor results
2. **Filter** to `status: "success"` only. If zero candidates, skip to Step 9.
3. **Rank** by `benchmark_score` (respecting `benchmark_direction`)
4. **Ranked-candidate loop** — for each candidate in rank order (best first):
   a. **No-regression check**: candidate score must improve or hold even vs `best_score`, respecting `benchmark_direction`
   b. **Merge**: `git merge experiment/round_{n}_executor_{id} --no-ff -m "Iteration {n}: {hypothesis} (score: {before} → {after})"`
   c. **Re-benchmark** on merged state to confirm improvement
   d. If re-benchmark **confirms** improvement: **accept winner**, break loop
   e. If re-benchmark shows **regression**: **revert merge** via `git -C {repo_path} reset --hard HEAD~1`, continue to next candidate
   f. If merge **conflicts**: `git -C {repo_path} merge --abort`, continue to next candidate
5. If a winner was accepted AND `auto_push` is `true` in settings: **Push** improvement branch. If `auto_push` is `false` (default): skip push.
6. **Archive** all non-winner branches: tag + delete
7. If no candidate survived the loop: no merge this round.
8. **Write Merge Report** JSON to `<self-improve-root>/state/merge_reports/round_{n}.json`

### Step 9 — Record & Visualize

1. Write iteration history to `<self-improve-root>/state/iteration_history/round_{n}.json`
2. Update `<self-improve-root>/state/agent-settings.json`:
   - Increment `iterations` by 1
   - If winner AND improvement exceeds `plateau_threshold`: update `best_score`, reset `plateau_consecutive_count = 0`, reset `circuit_breaker_count = 0`
   - If winner AND improvement below threshold: update `best_score` if better, increment `plateau_consecutive_count += 1`, reset `circuit_breaker_count = 0`
   - If no winner: increment `circuit_breaker_count += 1`
3. Append to `<self-improve-root>/tracking/raw_data.json` (one entry per candidate)
4. Run `python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/plot_progress.py --tracking-dir <self-improve-root>/tracking` for visualization
5. Archive plans: copy current round plans to `state/plan_archive/round_{n}/`

### Step 10 — Cleanup

Remove worktrees:
```
git -C {repo_path} worktree remove worktrees/round_{n}_executor_{id} --force
git -C {repo_path} worktree prune
```

Update `iteration_state.json` status to `completed`.

### Step 11 — Stop Condition Check

Evaluate ALL conditions. If ANY is true, exit:

| Condition | Check |
|---|---|
| User stop | `status == "user_stopped"` in agent-settings |
| Target reached | `best_score` meets/exceeds `target_value` (respecting direction) |
| Plateau | `plateau_consecutive_count >= plateau_window` |
| Max iterations | `iterations >= max_iterations` |
| Circuit breaker | `circuit_breaker_count >= circuit_breaker_threshold` |

If NO stop condition: immediately go back to Step 1.

---

## Resumability

**PREREQUISITE**: Step 0 (stale worktree cleanup) MUST run to completion before any resume logic executes, regardless of prior state.

On invocation, before entering the loop:

1. **Always run Step 0** (stale worktree cleanup) — even on fresh start
2. Read `<self-improve-root>/state/agent-settings.json`:
   - If `status: "user_stopped"`: ask user `"Previous run was stopped at iteration {N}. Resume? [yes/no]"`. If no, exit. If yes, continue.
   - If `status: "running"`: session crashed — resume automatically (no user prompt)
   - If `status: "idle"`: fresh start
3. Re-confirm trust gate only if `trust_confirmed` is `false` in agent-settings.json
4. Read `<self-improve-root>/state/iteration_state.json`:
   - `status: "in_progress"` → resume from `current_step`, skip completed sub-steps
   - `status: "completed"` → start next iteration
   - `status: "failed"` → complete recording step if needed, start next iteration
   - File missing → start from iteration 1

---

## Completion

When the loop exits:

1. Update agent-settings.json with final status
2. If `target_reached` AND `auto_pr` is `true` in settings: create PR from `improve/{goal_slug}` to upstream.
   If `auto_pr` is `false` (default): skip PR creation.
3. Run plot_progress.py one final time
4. Print summary report:
   ```
   === Self-Improvement Loop Complete ===
   Status: {status}
   Iterations: {iterations}
   Best Score: {best_score} (baseline: {baseline})
   Improvement: {delta} ({delta_pct}%)
   ```

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Agent fails to produce output | Retry once. If still no output, log and continue. |
| Researcher produces empty brief | Proceed — planners work from history alone. |
| All plans rejected by critic | Skip execution. Log. Continue to next iteration. |
| All executors fail | Skip tournament. Record failures. Continue. |
| Merge conflict | Reject candidate, try next. |
| Re-benchmark regression | Reject candidate, revert merge, try next. |
| Push failure | Log warning. Continue — push is backup. |
| Worktree already exists | Remove and recreate. |
| Settings corrupted | Report and stop. |

---

## Approach Family Taxonomy

Every plan must be tagged with exactly one:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `architecture` | Model/component structure changes |
| `training_config` | Optimizer, LR, scheduler, batch size |
| `data` | Data loading, augmentation, preprocessing |
| `infrastructure` | Mixed precision, distributed training, compiled kernels |
| `optimization` | Algorithmic/numerical optimizations |
| `testing` | Evaluation methodology changes |
| `documentation` | Documentation-only changes |
| `other` | Does not fit above — explain in evidence |

---

## Pipeline Integration

This skill is Phase 4 of the AI engineering pipeline. It consumes outputs from all prior phases:

- From **blueprint** (Phase 1): improvement direction and scope constraints
- From **architecture-decision-records** (Phase 2): historical decision records, avoiding repeated failed paths
- From **eval-harness** (Phase 3): benchmark commands and evaluation criteria

After self-improve completes:
- **Phase 5**: Invoke the `ai-slop-cleaner` skill to clean up evolution residue
